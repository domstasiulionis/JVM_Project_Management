# JVM_Project_Management

Created for COMP1815 - University of Greenwich - Software Engineering Y3. This is a project management application built in collaboration with three other teammates from the university. 
This application was built using the following programming languages: Java, Kotlin and Scala. 
The application is built only to service an administrative user to assist them in managing teams, members, task assignments amd deadlines.
The application does not support non-administrative members as this was beyond the scope of the project but could be implemented in future work.

For this project, I was personally responsible for all front-end development of the application using Java. Additionally, I also played a key-part in communicating with other group members to assist them in integrating their backend development with my frontend code.

Additionally, the report documenting this project that had been written at the time is also included in this repository.
