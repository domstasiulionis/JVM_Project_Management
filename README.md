#JVM_Project_Managemnet

Created for COMP1815 - University of Greenwich - Software Engineering Y3. This is a project management application built in collaboration with three other teammates from the university. 
This applicationw was built using the following programming languages: Java, Kotlin and Scala. 
The application is buiLt only to service an administrative user to aid them in managing teams, members, task assignments amd deadlines.
The application does not support non-administrative members as this was beyond the scope of the project but could be implemented in future work.

For this project, I was personally responsible for all front-end development of the application using Java. Additionally, I also played a key-part in communicating with other group members in order to assist them in integrating the backend development with my frontend code.
